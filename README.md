## History

This was my first game project for Windows Phone that I started during my first semester in early 2011. It started after reading the book [XNA 4.0 Game Development by Example: Beginners Guide](https://www.packtpub.com/product/xna-4-0-game-development-by-example-beginner-s-guide/9781849690669) by _Kurt Jaegers_. After learnings the basics of XNA using this book, I then extended the very basic _Asteroid Belt Assault_ space shooter, added many features and my own pixel art, and later finally published this game in the Windows Phone store.
